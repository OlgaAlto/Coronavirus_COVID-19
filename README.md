The first outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) was in Wuhan, in mid-December. On Jan 30th, the World Health Organization declared the Covid-19 a global emergency; and on 11 March they declared Covid-19 a pandemic.

In this project, I will analyze the spread of the new corona virus (nCov). I will use two datasets:

- The John Hopkins University's dataset which contains aggregated daily data for confirmed cases, deaths and recovered patients. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
- The DXY.cn's google sheet which contains information of about 1000 patients.
